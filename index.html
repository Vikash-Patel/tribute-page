            <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Dennis' life :</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1967 - He began working at the Bell Labs Computing Sciences Research Center.</li>
                <li>1968 - He defended his PhD thesis on "Program Structure and Computational Complexity" at Harvard under the supervision
                of Patrick C. Fischer. However, never officially received his PhD degree.</li>
                <li>1972 - He was best known as the creator of the C programming language, and co-author of the book The C Programming
                Language, and was the 'R' in K&R (a common reference to the book's authors Kernighan and Ritchie).</li>
                <li>1973 - He was a key developer of the Unix operating system, with Ken Thompson.</li>
                <li>1983 - Thompson and himself received the Turing Award for their development of generic operating systems theory and
                specifically for the implementation of the UNIX operating system. His Turing Award lecture was titled "Reflections on
                Software Research".</li>
                <li>1990 - Thompson and himself received the IEEE Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
                Engineers (IEEE), "for the origination of the UNIX operating system and the C programming language".</li>
                <li>1997 - Thompson and himself were made Fellows of the Computer History Museum, "for co-creation of the UNIX operating
                system, and for development of the C programming language."</li>
                <li>1999 - Thompson and himself jointly received the National Medal of Technology of 1998 from President Bill Clinton for
                co-inventing the UNIX operating system and the C programming language which, according to the citation for the medal,
                "led to enormous advances in computer hardware, software, and networking systems and stimulated growth of an entire
                industry, thereby enhancing American leadership in the Information Age".</li>
                <li>2005 - The Industrial Research Institute awarded him with its Achievement Award in recognition of his contribution to
                science and technology, and to society generally, with his development of the Unix operating system</li>
                <li>2011 - He, along with Thompson, was awarded the Japan Prize for Information and Communications for his work in the
                development of the Unix operating system.</li>
                <li>October 12, 2011 - He was found dead at the age of 70 at his home in Berkeley Heights, New Jersey, where he lived alone.
                His death came a week after the death of Steve Jobs but did not receive as much media coverage.</li>
            </ul>

                <p>"Ritchie was under the radar. His name was not a household name at all, but... if you had a microscope and could look in
                a computer, you'd see his work everywhere inside."</p>
                <cite>-- computer historian Paul E. Ceruzzi</cite>
